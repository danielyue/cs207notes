## Iterators
------------
- Iterators are defined by an order and an end.
- Check out the 'collections' modules!! They're a ton of good data structures available.
- break up iterator and iterable, so that the iterators can be iterated separately, and have separate lives.

## Generators
-------------
- generators yield rather than return items
- generators _are_ iterators, where they run until each yield and then stop.
- generators return themselves when you call 'iter(.)' on them
- you can run code instead of simply accessing something from storage!!

## Streams
----------
- Streams do not have state, and can be run over and over again.

## Tools
--------
- Look at 'itertools' and 'functools' libraries!!
