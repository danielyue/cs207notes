// is integer division in python


#there are problems in this code, but later
def binary_search(da_array, needle):
    rangemin = 0
    rangemax = len(da_array) - 1
    tries=0
    while True:
        print("at top", rangemin, rangemax)
        if tries > len(da_array):
            print("No Success")
            break
        midpoint = (rangemin+rangemax)//2 #whats the problem with this
        print(rangemin, midpoint, rangemax, "|", da_array[midpoint], needle)
        if da_array[midpoint] > needle:#lower part
            rangemax = midpoint - 1
        elif da_array[midpoint] < needle:
            rangemin = midpoint + 1
        else:
            return midpoint
        tries += 1

- The problem with the above is that we need to avoid numerical overflow
- Requires a sequence (defined length, indexable)
- needs to have a defined order on the members of the sequence
- can put strings anywhere in python, and it will ignore it.

from pydoc import doc as pydoc
from doctest import run_docstring_examples as dtest

?function -> gives the documentation on a specific function
pydoc(.) does the same thing

docTests --> scans for python prompts ">>>" and runs those commands to test system
